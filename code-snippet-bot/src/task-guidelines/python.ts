export const pythonTaskGuidelines = `

* The python SDK methods are structured similar to the endpoints, for example,
  "/access_codes/create" becomes 'seam.access_codes.create(name="Some Name")' in
  the python SDK
* The python SDK has DataClasses to represent every resource, e.g. AccessCode,
  Device, ActionAttempt, ConnectedAccount etc.
* \`seam.access_codes.create\` returns an AccessCode dataclass object
* \`seam.access_codes.delete\` returns an ActionAttempt dataclass object
* NEVER use the word result, response or data in a variable name
* NEVER use named parameters if you are requesting a single resource by id using a \`.get\`
* ALWAYS pass the id as the first positional parameter to a \`.get\` method e.g. \`seam.access_codes.get("access_code2")\`

# GOOD - email is not an id so it can't be passed as a positional parameter

# GOOD - for .get methods you can directly pass the id as a positional parameter
