# Seam Gitbook Plugin

We use this custom gitbook plugin for injecting custom Seam stuff into Gitbook, such as Seam
Components.

The documentation for Gitbook integrations is not great, you
should [reference their examples](https://github.com/GitbookIO/integrations) if you're doing development work here. In particular, [the mermaidjs integration is very similar](https://github.com/GitbookIO/integrations/blob/main/integrations/mermaid/src/index.tsx) You can see logs on the seam-gitbook-plugin integration page under Developer Settings when something fails to render.

## Usage
