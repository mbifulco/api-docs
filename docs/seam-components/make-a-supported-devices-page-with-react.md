# Make a Supported Devices Page with React

## Overview

Seam adds supports for smart devices every week and by integrating with
Seam, you get access to these new devices too!

This guide will show you how to drop [`<SupportedDeviceTable />`](https://react.seam.co/?path=/docs/example-supporteddevicetable--docs) into your
React application.

## 1 - Install `@seamapi/react` in your React application

```bash
npm install --save @seamapi/react
# or via yarn
yarn add @seamapi/react
```

## 2 - Get a Publishable Key from the Seam Console

To access the Seam API, you'll need a publishable key. This key
identifies your application when making requests to Seam and is
safe to embed in your frontend code.

Go to [console.seam.co](https://console.seam.co) and select
"Client Sessions" from the sidebar. You should then see a
"Publishable Key" that you can copy.

## 3 â€” Import and Drop In the [\<SupportedDeviceTable /> Component](https://react.seam.co/?path=/docs/example-supporteddevicetable--docs)

```javascript
import { SeamProvider, SupportedDeviceTable } from "@seamapi/react"

export const App = () => (
  <SeamProvider publishableKey="YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY">
    <SupportedDeviceTable />
  </SeamProvider>
)
```

You should see a list of device models like what's shown below:
