# Managing Scheduled Climate Settings - In Development

You can configure the following sets of climate settings for thermostats:

* [**Default climate setting**](setting-the-default-climate-setting.md) **\[in development]:** The set of default HVAC settings on a smart thermostat that applies when a [climate setting schedule](thermostats-climate-setting-schedules.md) endsâ€”such as when the room, unit, or home becomes vacant.
* [**Climate setting schedules**](thermostats-climate-setting-schedules.md) **\[in development]:** Smart thermostat schedules that control the climate for specific periods of time in users' homes or businesses.
