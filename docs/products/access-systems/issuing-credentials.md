# Issuing Credentials

Credentials determine the means by which a user gains access at an entrance. Types of credentials include access codes, key cards, and mobile passes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, Seam only supports the issuance of PIN codes for access.
{% endhint %}

## Create a Credential for a User

To [create a credential for a user](../../api-clients/access-control-systems/credentials/create-credential-for-user.md), provide the user ID (`acs_user_id`) and the desired [access (PIN) code](../smart-locks/access-codes/) (`code`).

Note the following restrictions for PIN codes:

* For [PTI Security Systemsâ„¢](../../device-guides/pti-storlogix-cloud.md), the PIN code value must be an integer in the range 1-4294967296.
* Duplicate PIN codes are not allowed within a system.

The response includes the ID (`acs_credential_id`) of the newly-created credential, the assigned code (`code`), and the user (`acs_user_id`) associated with the credential. &#x20;
