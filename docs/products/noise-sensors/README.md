# ðŸ‘‚ Noise Sensors

## What is a Noise Sensor?

Noise sensors are devices that measure that sound level in a given area. You can use noise sensors to monitor noise levels remotely and receive notifications when the noise volume is too loud. Seamâ€™s API allows you to configure the noise thresholds of a noise sensor and receive events when a disturbance is detected.

## What Is a Threshold?

Thresholds represent the limit of noise tolerated at a property, which can be customized for each hour of the day. Each device has its own default thresholds, but you can use the API to modify them.

## Use Cases

* You can configure noise threshold default settings for a customer's portfolio or on a property-by-property basis, and when a new noise sensor is added, you can use Seam's API to automatically configure its noise thresholds according to these defaults.
* You can react to noise disturbances by sending notifications to your users when a `noise_sensor.disturbance_detected` event gets fired. Seam will also notify you when the noise event has been resolved.
* Additionally, Seam provides prebuilt UI components for displaying a noise sensor's information. You can show the noise level, ways to configure noise thresholds, and the activity log of any noise events.

## **Best Practices**

While you can theoretically set noise thresholds to any decibel value, we have found that setting them within a specific range leads to fewer false positives:

| Property Type | Decibels |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Apartment     | 50-70    |
| House         | 70-90    |
| Estate        | 80-100   |
